NAME
       sysctl.conf - sysctl preload/configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       sysctl.conf is a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in and set by sysctl.  The syntax is simply as follows:

              # comment
              ; comment

              token = value

       Note that blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a token or value is ignored, although a value can contain whitespace within.  Lines which begin with a # or ; are considered comments and ignored.

NOTES
       As  the  /etc/sysctl.conf  file  is used to override default kernel parameter values, only a small number of parameters is predefined in the file.  Use /sbin/sysctl -a or follow sysctl(8) to list all possible parameters. The
       description of individual parameters can be found in the kernel documentation.

EXAMPLE
              # sysctl.conf sample
              #
                kernel.domainname = example.com
              ; this one has a space which will be written to the sysctl!
                kernel.modprobe = /sbin/mod probe

FILES
       /run/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
       /etc/sysctl.conf
              The paths where sysctl preload files usually exist.  See also sysctl option --system.
